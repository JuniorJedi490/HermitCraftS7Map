Builds:
-Xisuma's castle by PearlescentMoon
-Etho's ice farm, as commented by TheNargle
-Guardian farms (Jevin if not out of range, Impulse, False)
-The area containing Impulse's raid and chorus fruit farms
-Magic crystals (across the bay from Cub)
-GG map
-Zedaph's golf course

Separate currently merged builds:
-Bdubs' castle and base
-Joerassic Bark and Strait of Joebraltar, potentially

Tweaks/Changes:
-Fix spelling of 'Hermitterranean Sea'

That's enough for an update, but:
-Wait ~1 week more for the results of Xisuma's poll on whether to revert to the Beesuma skin
