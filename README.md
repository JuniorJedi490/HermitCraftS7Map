# Map of major HermitCraft Season 7 builds

This is a major overhaul of my old "Map of all Hermits' base locations!" project from r/HermitCraft. Now large builds are on the map regardless of whether anyone lives there.

Here you may find the main version of the map, an alternate version with text labels only, an alternate version with heads only, and all archived versions of the map.

# Notes:
1. Current bases are marked with gold text instead of the white text indicating other builds.
2. The actual location is marked as a head of the builder or with a Minecraft item. The corresponding text label is either below the head or attached with a line.
3. All locations are approximate; however, I have attempted to ensure that each build at least overlaps the corresponding head.

# FAQ:
- Where is xB?

Despite the large area this map encompasses, it still is not large enough to reach most of xB's builds. The distance between xB and the top right corner of the map is approximately the same as the distance between Keralis' city and the Straight of Joebraltar.

- Where is Scar's base?

Scar has moved Big Bud, which was previously his base, into the Nether. A map of the Nether is planned, but does not exist yet.

- Why is Iskall's hobbit hole shown on the map, but Mumbo's and Grian's are not?

I'm only showing starter bases if they meet one of the following criteria:
1. The base consists of or contains a very large build (e.g. Scar's village) or covers a wide area.
2. The owner continues to return to the base for one reason or another (e.g. Iskall's hobbit hole, which contains his villagers).
3. The starter base is distant from the owner's current base (e.g. Loser Island).

Additionally, if the starter base is usurped by the owner's current base or is so close that the icons would overlap, the starter base will be omitted.

Iskall's hobbit hole meets both the second and third criteria, but Mumbo's and Grian's hobbit holes meet none of them.

- What about <insert build name here>?
  
If you think I've missed a build, feel free to tell me in the comments on the reddit post at https://www.reddit.com/r/HermitCraft/comments/ip14wc/map_of_major_season_7_builds/. I will however require the builder's name and episode number if I am to actually add the build to the map.
